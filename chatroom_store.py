module that handles all the logic of managing chatroom data.
Managing chatroom data includes creating new chatrooms, deleting unused chatrooms, validating integrity,
updating the chatroom concept data and reviewing current users.

The data will be stored according to (possibly multiple) specifications.
Currently chatrooms are only stored in memory. Later they will be saved as JSON files on the webstore, or as a db.
